# SUMMARY
Veritasium and Casper explain normal versus power law distributions, revealing how self-organized criticality governs unpredictable natural and human systems.

# IDEAS:
*   Normal distributions cluster around an average, extreme outliers basically never happen.
*   Power laws show much more likelihood of really big events than expected normally.
*   Systems lacking inherent physical scale make future prediction exceedingly difficult.
*   Vilfredo Pareto discovered hidden income patterns, consistently showing a power law distribution.
*   Log-log plots transform power law curves into straight lines, revealing consistent gradients.
*   Income distributions across European countries followed the same power law equation.
*   Normal distributions arise when many random additive effects accumulate together.
*   Lognormal distributions occur when random effects multiply, leading to big inequalities.
*   The St. Petersburg paradox demonstrates an infinite theoretical expected value game.
*   Power law distributions have no measurable width, possessing an infinite standard deviation.
*   Averages in power law systems do not converge, continuously increasing with more measurements.
*   One extreme outlier can disproportionately dominate the calculated average value.
*   Exponential growth of payout combined with exponential decay of probability creates power laws.
*   Earthquakes demonstrate power laws with exponential frequency decay and energy release increase.
*   Power laws reveal a deeper, self-similar, fractal-like structure within underlying systems.
*   Magnets at critical points exhibit fractal patterns and domain sizes following power laws.
*   Systems in a critical state possess no intrinsic scale, a signature of self-organized criticality.
*   Local influences chain together at critical points, expanding influence range infinitely.
*   Critical systems are maximally unstable and unpredictable, where anything can potentially happen.
*   Forest fires naturally tune themselves to criticality, exhibiting self-organized behavior.
*   Forest fires follow power law distributions, revealing consistent mathematical patterns in disasters.
*   Large fires are magnified versions of small ones, often inevitable due to critical state.
*   Suppressing all small fires can lead to massive, catastrophic mega-fires eventually.
*   Allowing small fires to burn can reduce the likelihood of larger, more destructive events.
*   Earthquakes are unpredictable critical phenomena, with processes naturally producing vast scales.

*   Universality means physical details often don't matter at a system's critical point.
*   Incredibly complex systems can be modeled with basic toy models at criticality.
*   Many human systems like city populations and stock prices show power law behavior.
*   Power law distributions mean extreme events are much more common than normally assumed.
*   Insurance is designed to protect against large rare events in power law environments.
*   Venture capital thrives on power law distributions, seeking a few extraordinary outliers.
*   Book publishing and streaming platforms also depend on rare runaway hits for success.
*   Industries requiring consistent average performance cannot effectively play the power law game.
*   Knowing which game you're playing (normal vs. power law) dictates optimal behavior.
*   In power law worlds, persistence in riskier bets is more important than consistency.
*   New internet sites are more likely to link to already well-known, successful pages.
